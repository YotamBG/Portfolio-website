                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a passionate programmer with a keen interest in multiple
                    fields, constantly seeking opportunities to create something new, solve problems and automate processes in efficient ways.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There's nothing more satisfying for me than putting in the hard work on a programming project and
                    witnessing the creation of something that didn't exist before. It's this drive that led me to
                    specialize as a full-stack engineer, as it allows me to see the bigger picture of the projects I
                    work on and improve every aspect.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>As a full-stack developer, I prioritize using descriptive names for variables and ensuring that each
                class and function serves a clear purpose. I believe in the power of deleting unnecessary code to
                keep projects streamlined and maintain readability over cleverness. Consistency in coding style is
                important to me, and I strive to master the idioms of the languages I work with.</p>

            <p>Moreover, I understand the significance of choosing the right architecture for each project, as it
                plays a crucial role in its success. Embracing the concept that code can always be improved, I
                engage in an endless and efficient cycle of optimization. I strongly believe that software
                development is a team sport, and I value collaboration as a means to achieve outstanding results.
            </p>

            <p>Outside of programming, I am deeply curious about various fields, drawing inspiration from dance and
                language learning. These passions have taught me valuable skills, including discipline, creativity,
                and adaptability, which I readily apply to my work as a developer. Additionally, my fluency in
                English, Hebrew, and Spanish enables effective communication and collaboration with diverse teams
                and stakeholders.</p>

            <p>I am well-versed in using Git for version control, and I recognize the importance of automated tests
                to ensure software stability and reliability. With a strong work ethic, I approach every project
                with dedication and a commitment to delivering high-quality results.</p>

            <p>As I embark on my career, I am seeking a position that offers continuous growth and learning
                opportunities. Starting as a junior developer, I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise
                while progressing towards a senior role. I am looking for a supportive and nurturing environment
                that values personal and professional development. With my potential, enthusiasm, and dedication to
                growth, I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to a team that encourages
                innovation and fosters continuous improvement.</p>
